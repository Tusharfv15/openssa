FINANCIAL METRIC FORMULAS
=========================


Turnover Ratio Metric Formulas
------------------------------

`Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio` = (
  `Revenue` /
  `average Property, Plant & Equipment, a.k.a. PP&E, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
)

`Inventory Turnover Ratio` = (
  `Revenue` /
  `average Inventory, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
)


Profitability Margin Metric Formulas
------------------------------------

`Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Margin` = `Cost of Goods Sold, a.k.a. COGS` / `Revenue` 

`Gross (Income or Profit) Margin` = `Gross Income, a.k.a. Gross Profit` / `Revenue`

`Operating (Income or Profit) Margin` = `Operating Income, a.k.a. Operating Profit` / `Revenue`

`EBITDA Margin` = `Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization, a.k.a. EBITDA` / `Revenue`

`Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) Margin` = `Depreciation & Amortization, a.k.a. D&A` / `Revenue`

`EBIT Margin` = `Earnings before Interest & Tax, a.k.a. EBIT` / `Revenue`

`Net (Income or Profit) Margin` = `Net Income, a.k.a. Net Profit` / `Revenue`


Capital-Intensity / Return-on-Capital Metric Formulas
-----------------------------------------------------

`Return on Assets, a.k.a. RoA` = (
  `Net Income, a.k.a. Net Profit` /
  `average Total Assets, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
)


Liquidity Metric Formulas
-------------------------

`Quick Ratio` = (
  (`Cash & Cash Equivalents` + `Short-Term Investments` + `Accounts Receivable`)
  / `Current Liabilities`
)

`Working Capital Ratio` = `Current Assets` / `Current Liabilities`

`Operating Cash Flow Ratio` = `Cash Flows from Operations, a.k.a. Operating Cash Flows` / `Total Current Liabilities`

`Free Cash Flow Conversion Ratio` = ...

`Days Inventory Outstanding, a.k.a. DIO` = (
  365 * `average Inventory, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
  / `Cost of Goods Sold, a.k.a. COGS`
)

`Days Payable Outstanding, a.k.a. DPO` = (
  365 * `average Accounts Payable, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
  / (`Cost of Goods Sold, a.k.a. COGS` + `change in Inventory, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`)
)

`Days Sales Oustanding, a.k.a. DSO` = (
  365 * `average Accounts Receivable, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
  / `Revenue`
)

`Cash Conversion Cycle, a.k.a. CCC` = (
  `Days Inventory Outstanding, a.k.a. DIO` + `Days Sales Oustanding, a.k.a. DSO` - `Days Payable Outstanding, a.k.a. DPO`
)


CAPITAL-INTENSITY EVALUATION
============================

Capital-intensive businesses tend to have one or several of the following characteristics:
- high Fixed Assets as proportion of Total Assets
- high Capital Expenditure (CapEx) as proportion of Revenue
- low Return on Asset (RoA) metric value


FINANCIAL-ANALYSIS LANGUAGE/WORDING
===================================

- When we see the word "average" used before a Balance Sheet line item in financial-analysis contexts,
  it often means the simple arithmetic mean of that line item's values at two consecutive fiscal year-ends

- When we see the word "margin" in financial-analysis contexts,
  we usually need to divide a certain Profit-and-Loss (P&L) line item by the Total Revenue,
  for the concerned financial reporting period(s)

- When we see the word "turnover ratio" used after a Balance Sheet line item in financial-analysis contexts,
  we usually need to divide the Total Revenue for the fiscal year by the average of that Balance Sheet line item
  between the latest fiscal year-end and the immediately-preceeding fiscal year-end

- "Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)" is sometimes called "Cost of Revenue"
