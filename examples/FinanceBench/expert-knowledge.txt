FINANCIAL MARGIN METRICS

When we see the word "margin" in financial-analysis contexts,
we usually need to divide a certain Profit-and-Loss (P&L) line item by the Total Revenue,
for the concerned financial reporting period(s)


FINANCIAL METRIC FORMULAS

`Days Inventory Outstanding, a.k.a. DIO` = (
  365 * `average Inventory, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
  / `Cost of Goods Sold, a.k.a. COGS`
)

`Days Payable Outstanding, a.k.a. DPO` = (
  365 * `average Accounts Payable, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
  / (`Cost of Goods Sold, a.k.a. COGS` + `change in Inventory, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`)
)

`Days Sales Oustanding, a.k.a. DSO` = (
  365 * `average Accounts Receivable, typically between two consecutive fiscal year-ends`
  / `Revenue`
)

`Cash Conversion Cycle, a.k.a. CCC` = (
  `Days Inventory Outstanding, a.k.a. DIO` + `Days Sales Oustanding, a.k.a. DSO` - `Days Payable Outstanding, a.k.a. DPO`
)


MISCELLANEOUS / OTHER

- When we see the word "average" used before a Balance Sheet line item in financial-analysis contexts,
  it often means the simple arithmetic mean of that line item's values at two consecutive fiscal year-ends

- "Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)" is sometimes called "Cost of Revenue"
