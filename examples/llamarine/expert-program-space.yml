If the situation provided by the user is incorrect, the possible situations are both Head-on situation and the situation provided by the user. Maximum of 2 possible situations are allowed.

    - task: |-
        Find the most appropriate rule for each possible situation. For example: if a possible situation is Crossing, then apply the rule 15; if a possible situation is Head-on, then apply the rule 14. Maximum of 2 possible situations are allowed.
