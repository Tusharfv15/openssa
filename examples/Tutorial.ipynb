      "====================\n",
      "To assess whether 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, we\n",
      "need to consider the company's capital expenditures, the nature of its assets,\n",
      "and how these assets are utilized in the business.  From the 3M_2022_10K\n",
      "document, we know that 3M's capital expenditures for FY2022 were $1,749 million.\n",
      "This figure represents the amount 3M invested in fixed assets such as property,\n",
      "plant, and equipment (PP&E) during the fiscal year. Capital expenditures of this\n",
      "magnitude suggest significant investment in the physical assets required for\n",
      "production and operations, which is a characteristic of capital-intensive\n",
      "industries.  The depreciation and amortization expense for 3M in FY2022 was $498\n",
      "million. This expense reflects the cost of wear and tear or obsolescence of the\n",
      "company's fixed assets and intangible assets over time. The size of this expense\n",
      "can also be indicative of the scale of 3M's investment in its assets, as larger\n",
      "asset bases typically lead to higher depreciation and amortization expenses.\n",
      "However, without the total revenue figure for FY2022, we cannot calculate the\n",
      "ratio of capital expenditures to total revenue, which would have provided a\n",
      "clearer picture of capital intensity relative to the company's sales.  The\n",
      "nature of 3M's assets is diverse and includes current assets, long-term\n",
      "investments, PP&E, operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, and intangible\n",
      "assets. These assets are utilized across various business segments to support\n",
      "operations, manufacturing processes, and strategic initiatives. The substantial\n",
      "investment in PP&E is particularly relevant, as it underscores the company's\n",
      "reliance on physical assets for manufacturing its products.  Given the\n",
      "information provided, we can infer that 3M is likely a capital-intensive\n",
      "business. The significant capital expenditures, the reliance on PP&E for\n",
      "manufacturing, and the considerable depreciation and amortization expense all\n",
      "point towards a business model that requires substantial investment in fixed\n",
      "assets. This is further supported by the nature of 3M's assets, which are\n",
      "critical for its manufacturing capabilities and strategic initiatives aimed at\n",
      "long-term growth and value creation.  In conclusion, while the lack of a total\n",
      "revenue figure prevents us from calculating specific ratios that would further\n",
      "substantiate the capital intensity, the available FY2022 data suggests that 3M\n",
      "operates a capital-intensive business.\n"
