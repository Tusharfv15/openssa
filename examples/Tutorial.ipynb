      "--------------------------\n",
      "Based on the 2022 fiscal period data, the assessment of whether 3M is a capital-intensive company requires analyzing specific financial metrics. The key figures to consider are the Net Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E), Total Assets, Capital Expenditures (CapEx), Total Net Operating Revenue (Total Net Sales), and Net Income (Net Profit, or Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders).\n",
      "\n",
      "From the 3M 2022 10-K filing, we have the following data:\n",
      "\n",
      "- At the end of 2021, Net PP&E was $9,429 million, and Total Assets were $46,854 million.\n",
      "- At the end of 2022, Net PP&E was $9,178 million, and Total Assets were $45,073 million.\n",
      "- Capital Expenditures for 2022 were $1,749 million.\n",
      "- Total Net Sales for 2022 were $34,229 million.\n",
      "- Net Income for 2022 was $5,777 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine capital intensity, we look at the proportion of Net PP&E to Total Assets, Total Assets relative to Total Net Sales, Capital Expenditures relative to Total Net Sales, and the Return on Total Assets (RoA).\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The proportion of Net PP&E to Total Assets for 2022 is calculated as ($9,178 million / $45,073 million) * 100, which equals 20.36%. This figure is below the 25% threshold that might suggest a high capital intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The ratio of Total Assets to Total Net Sales for 2022 is $45,073 million / $34,229 million, which equals approximately 1.32 times. This is below the 2 times threshold, indicating that the company's assets are not excessively high compared to its revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Capital Expenditures relative to Total Net Sales for 2022 is ($1,749 million / $34,229 million) * 100, resulting in 5.11%. This is below the 10% threshold, suggesting that the company's investment in PP&E is not an overwhelmingly large portion of its sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Return on Total Assets (RoA) for 2022 is calculated by dividing Net Income by the average Total Assets between the end of 2021 and 2022: ($5,777 million / $45,963.5 million) * 100, which equals 12.57%. This is above the 10% threshold, indicating efficient use of assets to generate profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these calculations, 3M does not meet the typical criteria for being classified as a capital-intensive company for the 2022 fiscal period. The proportion of Net PP&E to Total Assets, the ratio of Total Assets to Total Net Sales, and the Capital Expenditures relative to Total Net Sales are all below the thresholds that would indicate a high level of capital intensity. Additionally, the RoA is above the threshold, suggesting that the company is generating a reasonable return on its assets. Therefore, according to the provided data and criteria, 3M would not be considered capital-intensive for the 2022 fiscal period.\n",

      "To assess whether 3M is capital-intensive according to the 2022 fiscal period data, we can look at the information provided by the '3M_2022_10K' resource. Capital intensity is typically determined by looking at the amount of capital investment relative to the labor employed in the company. A capital-intensive company is one that requires significant investment in physical assets such as property, plant, and equipment to generate revenue, and often has a high proportion of fixed assets compared to total assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the '3M_2022_10K' resource, 3M has made significant investments in property, plant, and equipment, which is indicative of a capital-intensive business. The ongoing capital expenditures to support growth, productivity, and sustainability further reinforce this assessment. The substantial amount of total debt and net debt suggests that 3M relies on debt financing to fund its capital investments, which is common for capital-intensive companies that need large upfront investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cash flows from investing activities, which show notable investments in property, plant, and equipment, also support the conclusion that 3M is capital-intensive. The expected capital spending for 2023 of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion indicates that 3M continues to invest heavily in its capital assets. Additionally, the diverse portfolio of debt instruments with varying maturities and interest rates in the company's long-term debt and short-term borrowings table suggests a reliance on substantial capital to support operations and strategic objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, based on the 2022 fiscal period data, which includes significant investments in capital assets, high levels of debt, and ongoing capital expenditure plans, 3M can be confidently classified as a capital-intensive company.\n",
