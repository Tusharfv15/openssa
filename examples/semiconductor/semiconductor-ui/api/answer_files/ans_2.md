To determine the required dry tons of lime-stabilized biosolids per acre for meeting the nitrogen (N) requirements of the corn crop, we need to follow a multi-step process. We'll use the Plant-Available Nitrogen (PAN) formula provided in the document to calculate the PAN from the biosolids and then apply the agronomic nitrogen rate formula to determine the dry tons per acre.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

### **Step 1: Gather the given information**

- **NO3-N (nitrate nitrogen)** = 1,500 ppm = 1,500 ÷ 1,000,000 × 2,000 = **3 lbs/ton**  
- **NH4-N (ammonium nitrogen)** = 3,000 ppm = 3,000 ÷ 1,000,000 × 2,000 = **6 lbs/ton**  
- **TKN (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen)** = 20,000 ppm = 20,000 ÷ 1,000,000 × 2,000 = **40 lbs/ton**

The total organic nitrogen (Org-N) is calculated by subtracting the NO3-N and NH4-N from TKN:

- **Org-N** = 40 - (3 + 6) = **31 lbs/ton**

Additionally:
- **Expected corn yield** = 100 bushels/acre
- **N requirement** = 1.1 lbs N/bushel × 100 bushels/acre = **110 lbs N/acre**

### **Step 2: Use the PAN formula**

The formula for PAN is:

\[
PAN = \text{NO}_3\text{-N} + K_{vol} (\text{NH}_4\text{-N}) + K_{min} (\text{Org-N})
\]

Where:
- **Kvol** is the volatilization factor, which accounts for nitrogen losses due to volatilization of ammonium nitrogen. A typical value for surface-applied biosolids disked within 24 hours is 0.75.
- **Kmin** is the mineralization factor, which represents the fraction of organic nitrogen that becomes available to plants. A typical value for the first year is 0.30.

Now we calculate the PAN:

\[
PAN = 3 + 0.75 \times 6 + 0.30 \times 31
\]

Breaking it down:
\[
PAN = 3 + 4.5 + 9.3 = 16.8 \, \text{lbs N/ton of biosolids}
\]

This means that each dry ton of biosolids will supply 16.8 lbs of plant-available nitrogen (PAN) to the corn.

### **Step 3: Calculate the required dry tons of biosolids per acre**

Next, we use the agronomic N rate formula to determine how many dry tons of biosolids are needed to meet the nitrogen requirement of 110 lbs N/acre:

\[
\text{Dry tons biosolids/acre} = \frac{\text{Adjusted N rate (lbs N/acre)}}{\text{PAN (lbs N/ton)}}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Dry tons biosolids/acre} = \frac{110 \, \text{lbs N/acre}}{16.8 \, \text{lbs N/ton}} = 6.55 \, \text{dry tons/acre}
\]

### **Step 4: Additional Expert Considerations**

In practice, it's important to consider the moisture content and solids percentage of the biosolids when converting from dry tons to wet tons, as well as environmental factors that may affect nitrogen volatilization or mineralization rates.

For example, if the biosolids are 25% solids, then the wet tons of biosolids required would be:

\[
\text{Wet tons/acre} = \frac{\text{Dry tons/acre}}{\text{Solids percentage}} = \frac{6.55}{0.25} = 26.2 \, \text{wet tons/acre}
\]

Other factors, such as soil type, crop rotation, and incorporation methods, can also affect nitrogen availability. For instance, a sandy soil with low organic matter may experience higher N losses, requiring a slight adjustment in the biosolids application rate. It’s also crucial to monitor soil pH, as lime-stabilized biosolids could potentially increase the pH, influencing nutrient availability for the crop.

### **Conclusion**

To meet the nitrogen needs of your corn crop yielding 100 bushels per acre, you will need to apply **6.55 dry tons** of biosolids per acre. However, when considering practical aspects like the moisture content of the biosolids, you would need **26.2 wet tons per acre** if the biosolids are 25% solids.

This process ensures that the nitrogen supply aligns with crop needs while optimizing nutrient use and minimizing environmental impact, ensuring long-term soil health and crop productivity.
