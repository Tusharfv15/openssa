To determine whether herbicide resistance is developing in your giant ragweed and waterhemp populations, and to manage it effectively, follow this actionable, localized approach:
Step 1: Quick Assessment for Resistance
Start by conducting a simple field scouting after herbicide application. Look for areas where these weeds are surviving despite being exposed to the correct rates of herbicide. Check if the survival is limited to a specific area (indicating resistance) or if it’s more widespread (which could indicate other issues like application timing or coverage).
Step 2: Conduct a Jar Test (On-Farm Bioassay)
Collect seeds from the surviving ragweed and waterhemp plants and grow them in pots. Apply different herbicides, including the one you've been using, at recommended rates. If the weeds survive where they shouldn't, that’s a clear indicator of resistance.
Step 3: Rotate Herbicide Modes of Action
Immediately adjust your herbicide program by switching to herbicides with different modes of action (MOA) for the next season. For example, if you’ve been relying on a Group 9 herbicide (e.g., glyphosate), switch to a PPO inhibitor (Group 14) or HPPD inhibitor (Group 27) for postemergence control. Layering a Group 15 preemergence herbicide can help control later-emerging waterhemp.
Step 4: Use Cultural Practices
Incorporate cover crops like cereal rye after harvesting, which can suppress weed germination. In addition, use narrow row spacing in soybean to help your crop canopy close faster, reducing the sunlight available to weeds.
Step 5: Monitor and Adjust
Scout the fields regularly throughout the season to see how the new herbicide rotation works. Adjust your approach each year by monitoring weed pressures and switching MOAs to avoid applying the same herbicide repeatedly.
