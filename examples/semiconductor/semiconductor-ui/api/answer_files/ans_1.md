To determine whether herbicide resistance is developing in giant ragweed and waterhemp in your soybean field, and to implement an effective management strategy, follow these steps:
### **Step 1: Identifying Herbicide Resistance**
#### **Field Scouting for Resistance**
Set up a bi-weekly scouting schedule during the early growth stages of soybean crops, record weed survival in  areas where herbicides have been less effective historically. Focus on patches where giant ragweed and waterhemp survive after herbicide application. If these populations expand year by year, that’s a clear indicator of resistance. 
#### **Evaluate Herbicide Performance**
If other weeds listed on the herbicide label are still effectively controlled, but giant ragweed and waterhemp persist, this often signals species-specific resistance. Review the field’s history of herbicide use, particularly if you’ve relied heavily on a single herbicide or a mode of action over several seasons.
### **Step 2: Rule Out Other Causes**
Before concluding that resistance is the problem, eliminate other potential reasons for herbicide failure, such as:
- **Inconsistent application rates**
- **Adverse environmental conditions** (too dry or wet when applied)
- **Incorrect timing** (e.g., applying herbicide too late, when weeds have already exceeded optimal height for control)

### **Step 3: Managing Herbicide Resistance**

#### **Rotating Herbicide Modes of Action (MOA)**
To reduce resistance, rotate to herbicides with different MOAs. Avoid using the same site of action consecutively. For instance, if you’ve been using a Group 9 herbicide (e.g., glyphosate), switch to a Group 14 (PPO inhibitors) or Group 27 (HPPD inhibitors). This disrupts the selection pressure on the weed population, making it harder for resistance to develop.
#### **Tank Mixtures**
Use a combination of glyphosate and a PPO inhibitor in a single tank mixture for postemergence applications. The dual MOA approach will tackle resistant weeds from different biochemical pathways.
### **Step 4: Integrated Weed Management**
#### **Mechanical and Cultural Control**
Incorporate mechanical control measures such as rotary hoeing or inter-row cultivation alongside herbicide applications to physically disrupt resistant weed populations. Additionally, cultural practices like delaying planting or using cover crops can reduce weed pressure by altering their growth windows.
### **Step 5: Monitor and Adjust**
#### **Scouting After Application**
Continue scouting fields post-herbicide application to detect weed escapes or shifts in population dynamics. If resistance continues to spread, consider more drastic measures, such as changing cropping systems or more aggressive mechanical controls.
