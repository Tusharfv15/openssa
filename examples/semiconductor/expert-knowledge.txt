General Considerations for Etching SiO2:

Selectivity: Achieving higher SiO2 etch rate than PR mask.
Polymer Redeposition: Reducing fluorine content, increasing bias power, adding polymer-reducing gas.
Etch Rate: Balancing plasma density, ion energy, and reactant gas flow rates.
Recipe Suggestions:

Fluorine-based etch:
CF4: 50 sccm, CHF3: 20 sccm, Ar: 10 sccm.
ICP power: 800 W, Bias power: 100 W.
Pressure: 10 mTorr, Temperature: 20°C.
Chlorine-based etch:
Cl2: 50 sccm, Ar: 20 sccm, O2: 10 sccm.
ICP power: 1000 W, Bias power: 150 W.
Pressure: 15 mTorr, Temperature: 20°C.
Hybrid etch:
CF4: 30 sccm, Cl2: 20 sccm, Ar: 10 sccm, O2: 10 sccm.
ICP power: 900 W, Bias power: 120 W.
Pressure: 12 mTorr, Temperature: 20°C.
Additional Tips:

Optimize PR mask: Proper baking and development.
Monitor etch process: Optical emission spectroscopy, mass spectrometry.
Pre-etch treatment: Brief fluorine-based plasma.
Post-etch treatment: Brief oxygen plasma.
