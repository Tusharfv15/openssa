  task: |-
    Monitor RF Power fluctuation and recommend inspection/maintenance actions if fluctuation is excessive

  sub-htps:
    - task: >-
        What are the values of Reflected Power in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether the lowest and highest Reflected Power values differ by more than 15%.
        If so, note down the corresponding wafer batch number range between them.

    - task: >-
        What are the values of Forward Power in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether the lowest and highest Forward Power values differ by more than 10%.
        If so, note down the corresponding wafer batch number range between them.

    - task: |-
        If there are excessive fluctuations in both Reflected Power and Forward Power in the previous analyses,
        and if the wafer batch number ranges overlap, report a RF Power Fluctuation problem,
        and recommend the following maintenance actions:
        - Inspect the electrodes
        - Adjust gas flow
        - Adjust power settings
