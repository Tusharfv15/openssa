# `OpenSSA`: Unmatched Accuracy, Powered by Domain Knowledge

Struggling with accuracy on your RAG projects? You're not alone.

The core problem? Generic language models, which fall short in delivering the accuracy and relevance required for complex, multi-step problems.

Meet OpenSSA â€” an open-source framework that boosts RAG accuracy to a minimum of 80% by leveraging domain-specific fine-tuned models.
